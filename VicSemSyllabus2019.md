> Replacing “How something is made, with a view to finding out what it is” with “How something is made, with a view to making it again” – the Essence with the Preparation – is linked to an option that’s completely antiscientific: in reality, the starting point of the Fantasy [of the critic’s writing a novel] isn’t the Novel (in general, as a genre), but one or two novels out of thousands. -Roland Barthes, The Preparation of the Novel, Session of December 9, 1978, 13.

This research-intensive honors seminar centers around two simple central questions: *How are Victorian novels made?* and *How is scholarship about Victorian novels made?* We will focus on the Victorian novel as both a genre and a material object, examining it within the context of the broader world of Victorian literature and culture in order to examine the ways in which the Victorian novel was both product and producer of its historical moment. We will explore the possibilities for rethinking canonical twentieth-century theories of novelistic realism, following a recent flourishing in Victorianist criticism on referentiality in order to ask how Victorian novels may be said to refer to the real worlds their authors and readers inhabited. In order to study this theoretical question, we will turn to the set of practices and processes through which Victorian novelists gathered the things of the world into their novels: research. Reading several major and minor Victorian novels, we will trace different forms of evidence of the ways their authors searched sets of documents, took notes, and organized information to perform research of all kinds in the library and on the streets. We will examine the published and unpublished commonplace books, notecards, papers, files, and marginalia of Victorian novelists both canonical and forgotten along with published descriptions of these novelists’ research practices and their representations of research in the novels they wrote. We will engage with criticism and theory from a number of fields, including book history, theories of materiality, historicisms old and new, theories of narrative and realism, genetic and textual criticisms, bibliometrics, media history, and digital humanities.

This class will help you develop our skills in research in print, digital, and manuscript or typescript sources; how to use and evaluate a range of databases and digital tools; how to think about citation practices as substantive and central to our work as scholars of literature. It will ask you to examine your own implicit and explicit research practices and habits, and (in some cases) to experiment with modifying them or developing new ones. We may incorporate various computational elements into our work, from the basics of plain-text authoring, citation management, and keeping an open research notebook to using digital tools to help us analyze individual novels and groups of novels.

### Assignments

#### Outline and discussion facilitation
Every other week you will be responsible – in pairs - for
facilitating discussion of the week’s material, including (but not at
all limited to) all readings, seminar papers, close readings, critical
summaries, and research exercises. Please plan to read the week’s
materials, come up with a draft of the outline (in informal consultation
with other seminar members if you like), and post your draft outline by
Thursday at 7 pm to our outline site (more on which in class).  On Thursday evening, the rest of the seminar members will access the outline
and may add their own suggestions. Then on Friday at 10:30 am the
discussion leaders will meet with me briefly in order strategize and
finalize the outline. I will then provide copies for use in class. We
can certainly diverge from this outline, but it is useful for us to have
a general map of how you imagine the shape of the discussion might
unfold. The outline is an interesting genre in and of itself; we’ll talk
about its limitations and possibilities, its uses as a preparation for
class, as a map during class, and as an enduring artifact after class is
over. I can provide examples from past seminars if you wish. The
outline is also (unlike your seminar papers, close readings, and
criticism summaries) a public document, which we will likely share in
some form. We will format all outlines in Markdown and use Pandoc to convert
them into PDF for to print for reference during seminar.

#### Seminar papers
You will write three 1500-2500 word (3-4 page single-spaced) seminar papers over the course of the semester; they are due to our seminar Dropbox (more on
which in class) by 7 pm the Wednesday before seminar.  The seminar
paper should usually (although this is a guideline not a requirement)
engage with at least one novel – making sure to include at least some
close reading of the novel - and one piece of criticism. I also
encourage you to bring in outside reading that seems relevant (though
make sure that you do this in a way that is attentive to the fact that
the rest of us will likely not have read your additional text(s)).

#### Close readings
You will write three 1-2-page single-spaced close readings of a few
sentences or a paragraph of one of our fictional texts over the course
of the semester; they are due to our seminar Dropbox (more on which in
class) by 7 pm the Wednesday before seminar.

#### Criticism summaries
You will write three 1-2 page (single-spaced) summaries of critical
readings; like the seminar papers and close readings, they are due as
PDFs or Word attachments by 7 pm the Wednesday before seminar. These should usually include a brief paragraph on the main claim and stakes of the reading, a more detailed overview of the argument, a note if relevant on the writer’s style, feeling, and tone, and particular mention (with page numbers) of points/passages you think are especially important for our purposes and/or require our critique. See handout on “reading criticism” for guidance if you like.

#### Research notes
This is a research intensive seminar. By "research intensive," I mean
that in addition to reading and responding to the texts included on the
syllabus according to the terms and questions I put forward, you will be
learning to both ask and answer your own questions about the Victorian
novel. We’ll also attempt to reflect on the research process, looking at
our own assumptions about what research is and does as compared with the
research practices of Victorian novelists (among others).

#### Seminar archive and site
Our seminar's public site will feature at minimum our seminar's syllabus and our
discussion outlines. Together we will think about any additional elements of our
work we may want to make public.

#### Open classes
Occasionally if relevant we will open our class to interested outside parties. Feel free to invite friends, family, teammates, labmates, housecats, that guy who is always hanging out in the periodicals reading room. More on this in class.

#### Tools
To start exploring and thinking about your individual and collective
process of exploratory research, knowledge organization, and
note-taking, we may experiment with a range of technologies. Our goal is to both use digital tools to do humanities work and to use our finely-honed
humanities tools to both *critique* and *use* digital technologies.

#### Long/Senior Honors Study paper
I want us to think about the long paper as a piece that draws together
some of the various shorter writing pieces, research skills, and
projects you will work on over the course of the semester. The long
paper may draw on any aspect of the work you have done in the seminar;
it should include an original argument about one of our novels, respond
to the existing criticism of that novel, and incorporate original
research. A substantial 4-5 page proposal, including a research
organization and technology plan, and perhaps the beginning of the
paper, is due before March break, with a rough draft due soon after in
early April.  If you are in Honors, this will become your SHS paper. I
would like – but will not require because different students’ interests
and needs will vary – for this paper to incorporate some significant
original research.

#### Final written and oral exam
During finals period you will take a three-hour written exam; you may
use your notes and books. You will then take an oral exam during finals
period based on this exam, your long paper, and the entire semester’s
readings. This is separate from and in addition to Honors examinations.

#### Seminar break
Each of you will bring break a few times during the semester. Consult
with one another, and be creative! If this will be a financial hardship,
please consult me.

#### Reading and note-taking, technology
We will use various technologies we will use to facilitate various forms
of individual and collective note-taking, writing, archiving, and
computational text analysis. In addition, we will use laptops
intentionally and strategically during some parts of class but not
others; more on this during our first meeting. Group leaders will be
responsible for thinking about if, how, and when to use technologies
like this in class. (If you do not own a laptop, no worries; we can work
around this, but do let me know.)

#### Extra meetings and other specific seminar-related times
Please reserve Friday at 10:30 am to meet with me during the weeks you are in charge of discussion and outline.

*This double-credit Honors seminar is a major commitment, and
requires a lot of work. I realize this, and look forward to working with
you all so that we can mutually make sure that we have the time and
space we need to do a good job while also fulfilling our other semester
commitments and attempting to be relatively happy people (or as happy as
we’re disposed to be).*

#### Accommodations for disability
I want to work to make sure that everyone in this class has the access
to the materials, resources, and support they need in order to learn
most effectively. You are always free to talk to me about your own
situation.  A key Swarthmore resource in this area is the Office of
Student Disability Services. Their accommodations policy is here: If you
believe that you need accommodations for a disability, please contact
Leslie Hempling in the Office of Student Disability Services (Parrish
113) or email lhempli1@swarthmore.edu to arrange an appointment to
discuss your needs. As appropriate, she will issue students with
documented disabilities a formal Accommodations Letter. Since
accommodations require early planning and are not retroactive, please
contact her as soon as possible. For details about the accommodations
process, visit the Student Disability Service Website at
http://www.swarthmore.edu/academic-advising-support/welcome-to-student-
disability-service.  You are also welcome to contact me [the faculty
member] privately to discuss your academic needs. However, all
disability-related accommodations must be arranged through the Office of
Student Disability Services.

#### Dean's Discretionary Fund and Dean's Office resources for basic needs

If purchasing your textbooks or other materials for this or any other class present a serious financial difficulty for you, you should be aware of the [Dean's Discretionary Fund](http://www.swarthmore.edu/student-life/deans-discretionary-funding-request-guidelines) and other resources such as the Course Book Collection in Underhill Library in Lang Music.

The Dean's Office describes the fund  this way:

> The spirit of this funding is primarily to support emergency circumstances and priority is given to students in the highest financial need tiers.  Funding is usually limited to under $500 and most grants are under $300.  Please note the Dean's Office may not be able to fulfill all requests.

> Examples of eligible non-academic requests include, but are not limited to, expenses associated with emergency medical, dental, vision procedures, unanticipated trips home due to a family emergency, and various fees related to postgraduate opportunities.

The Student Life office at Swarthmore is very committed to making sure that all students having living situations that support their ability to work and live here successfully. If you find that you are having sustained difficulties with your food or housing situation and believe that this may affect your course performance, you should contact your class dean; you are also free to contact me if you wish so that I can help you find the support you need.

#### Plagiarism
Plagiarism is a very serious offense. It includes both the direct
copying of the words of another person without crediting him or her and
paraphrasing the ideas of another person without giving credit. If you
have any questions about how to properly cite another person’s work,
please do not hesitate to ask me.

#### Attendance and due dates
Because this is a seminar, attendance is essential. Missing seminar
(except for cases of illness or true emergencies) is inadvisable.
However, if you are really ill, try to contact me ahead of time, but do
plan to miss class! *Again, because this is a seminar, deadlines for
seminar papers, critical summaries, and outlines are (again, outside of
serious emergency situations) firm, firm, firm.* Plan ahead.

#### Your Own Devices Policy
Because our class is intensively collaborative,  I will expect that you
will be focused on the texts and on your classmates. If it is your
experience that having a screen in front of you can distract you from
the work of being in class, please take measures to prevent such
self-distraction. (I've used [StayFocused](http://www.stayfocusd.com); you
may like other programs or strategies.)
