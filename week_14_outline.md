## Reductive Reading: On Critical Practice

This semester we have thought a lot about the process novelists use to write novels.
Rarely do we get to see a critic explain the process of her coming to critique,
let alone reflect on criticism that reflects on an author reflecting on their writing.

+ What is reductive reading?
+ What does it situate itself against?
+ Work through the essay page by page, ask Rachel to clarify any necessary items

## Stylometric analysis: Discerning Syntax at the level of the sentence

+ Walk through the method and nature of Allison's argument

### Examples from the text

+ Hali's close reading
+ Collectively close read various ones Allison herself uses

## How characters understand their own minds: Eliot and hyper-consciousness
    
+ Claim: Characters seem unusually conscious of themselves in *Middlemarch*
+ Can we work through this claim? Perhaps by characterizing, in an Allisonian manner, the way consciousness is rendered?
+ If you brought a laptop, bring it out. We are going to search (god-forbid!) various related keywords to find sites to dive into.
+ What are the limitations of our method? The benefits?

## Novels and death

+ Sagnick's reading: scripting the scene of one's funeral
+ Stonefeather's wills as a site of conflicting authorial intention
    + *Middlemarch* is two novels thrown into one
    + Allison characterizes a few ways in which the text is at odds with itself
        + Criticism vs. sympathy
        + The exemplary Dorothea against her burgeoning desire to benefit the common good.

## The sociality of debt, money

As we read last week, David Kurnick begins "An Erotics of Detachment" by saying:
> But while Middlemarch is arguably the most perfect realization of the novel’s ambition to present a historicized picture of the social whole, it is more disturbingly, a book that seems reluctant to share these intellectual riches with its characters."

That's all well and good, but how do characters understand one another?

+ Claim: Characters are understood by other characters in two primary ways:
    + Monetarily
    + Matrimonially (in which there is an explicit monetary tension present)
